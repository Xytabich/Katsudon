Katsudon is a compiler of IL assemblies (including plugins) directly into the UDON VRChat program.

The utility was created for more convenient work with the unity, as close as possible to the usual one. Whenever possible, many standard methods of working with objects and other things will be implemented here.

This compiler is mainly intended for those who are already familiar with scripting in Unity, but due to some limitations of Udon some things may be different. You can read more about this on the [wiki](https://github.com/Xytabich/Katsudon/wiki/Difference-from-regular-use-of-C%23).

### Setup
First of all, download and import these packages:
- [VRChat SDK3 for Worlds](https://vrchat.com/home/download)
- The latest Katsudon [release](https://github.com/Xytabich/Katsudon/releases/latest)

Next comes the [environment setup](https://github.com/Xytabich/Katsudon/wiki/How-to-work).
Then you can transfer your scripts to this environment (do not forget to take into account the limitations of Katsudon) or create new ones.

All the highlights are on the [wiki](https://github.com/Xytabich/Katsudon/wiki).

### Remarks
- Katsudon was designed to automatically support Udon's functionality, so there are such things as a dynamically updated list of udon functionality (also known as Udon cache).
Therefore, you can often use Katsudon for the latest versions of the VRChat SDK. But if new functionality appears, updates will be carried out.
- At the moment this utility is in the alpha stage, so many things may not be implemented and some parts may not be optimized.
